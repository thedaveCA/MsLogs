# Sample files

## addresslist.txt

A collection of e-mail addresses generated using an online tool. I used these for testing early on in the development, and will use it later once I implmement the log generator demo.

17499 e-mail addresses total, of which 1648 are `example.com` and 1719 are `example.net`, representing a collection of e-mail with a mixture of random external addresses and a set of internal addresses that will have a large number of mailboxes within a single domain, and appear more frequently.

## ServerUnmappableException.log.txt

A sample MailStore logfile of a real MailStore Server archiving profile execution using synthetic test data.

## mailstore.log.txt

Short sample that was missed by the initial obfuscation code.
